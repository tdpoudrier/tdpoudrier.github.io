## Styling Text
- **Use two asterisks to bold text or two underscores, shortcut is ctrl+B**
- *one asterisks for italics or one underscore, shortcut is ctrl+I*
- ~~Strikethrough is two tilda and has no shortcut~~
- **bold and italic can be used within eachother to show *very* important information**
- For subscripts you uses angle brakets around sub and end with angle brakets around /sub, an equation would be F<sub>1</sub> = ma
- Superscripts follow the same format as subscripts but with sup, for example c<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup>
- Also created a list to properly display this seciton using - for each item in the list. New lines in github editor do not display on readme
